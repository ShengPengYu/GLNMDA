# GLNMDA
GLNMDA Â is a project developed in java language. Before introducing this project, I want to explain the following points:
(1). The project was developed based on a matrix library named ND4j(https://nd4j.org/). 
(2). In order to introduce the project documents more clearly, I put all the source code on the front page.
(3). As GitHub has upload capacity limit, I did not upload the third party jar package, only uploaded the core code of the project.
