# GLNMDA
GLNMDA Â is a project developed in java language. Before introducing this project, I want to explain the following points:
(1). The project was developed based on a matrix library named ND4j(https://nd4j.org/). 
(2). In order to introduce the project documents more clearly, I put all the source code on the front page.
(3). As GitHub has upload capacity limit, I did not upload the third party jar package, only uploaded the core code of the project.

1. File list:
1.1. Datas.java----------------It is a class for storing data sets needed for experiments.
1.2. Job.java------------------The prediction work is done in this class.
1.3. RSM.java------------------Using Global Linear neighborhoods to reconstruct the similarity network.
1.4. Parameters.java-----------recorded the super parameters used in this project

2. Folder list:
2.1. dataset-------------------The data set used in the project is placed in this folder.
  2.1.1. dss.mat---------------Disease similarity network,It is a Matlab format data and can be load by LoadDataUtils.java
  2.1.2. dssname.txt-----------Recorded the all diseases name.
  2.1.3. interaction.mat-------Recordeed the all disease-miRNA associations.
  2.1.4. mfs.mat---------------miRNA similarity network,It is a Matlab format data and can be load by LoadDataUtils.java
  2.1.5. mfsname.mat-----------Recorded the all miRNAs name.
2.2. output--------------------The prediction result produced by our method.
  2.2.1. add_prediction.txt----The prediction result based on known disease-miRNA associations.
  2.2.2. new_-rediction.txt----The prediction result based on removing all known disease-miRNA associations.
2.3. utils---------------------A tool set 
  2.3.1. GUIutils.java---------Showing the matrix by GUI.
  2.3.2. LoadDataUtils.java----Loading data to memory.
